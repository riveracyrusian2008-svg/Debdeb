                        &emsp; hi bebe, ik this letter may come a bit late, but please know it comes from the deepest part of my heart. i’m truly sorry for not reaching out sooner after our argument. it was never my intention to make you feel ignored or unimportant. the truth is, gumagawa ako ng paraan para suyuin ka. i'm trying to create something special for u, making websites and small gestures to show how much i care. i wanted to express my sincerity in a way that would touch your heart. but i couldn’t do it right away dahil late ako nakahiram ng laptop, and ik that caused a delay in what should have been a moment of comfort for u.
even if i couldn’t speak to u directly, i never stopped thinking of u. kanina bebe, pinanood kita sa live mo, and i kept checking your tiktok from time to time not to invade your space, but to let u know in some small way na nandito lang ako, na hindi ako lumayo, na mahal pa rin kita. i want you to know, and never doubt, that i’m still here. i still choose you every single day. i’m sorry if my silence made you question that. i just wanted to give you something beautiful as a way to say how sorry i am, how much i appreciate u, and how deeply i want to make things right. i’m not going anywhere. i’m still holding on. i still believe in us. and i’ll keep trying, kahit gaano kahirap, kahit gaano katagal, just to make u feel loved, secured, and never alone.
